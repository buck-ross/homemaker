# Homemaker
A collection of files and scripts to help make new home directories feel more like a home.

## Getting Started
  1. Enter the target home directory: `cd ~`
  2. Download the latest release: `curl -Lo homemaker.tar.gz https://github.com/haximilian/homemaker/releases/download/v1.0.0-ALPHA.0/homemaker.tar.gz`
  3. Extract the tarball: `tar xzpvf homemaker.tar.gz`
  4. **(optional)** At this point, you can make whatever changes you like to the release contents.
  5. Run the initialization script: `sh ./homemaker.sh`

The initialization script will automatically initialize your new home directory, and then clean up after itself, leaving your new home directory ready for use.
